# Titanic: Predicting Survival with Machine Learning 

## Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis and solution to the [Kaggle Titanic survival prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview). The notebook is designed to be beginner-friendly, avoiding unnecessary technical jargon and providing detailed explanations of each analysis step. It also includes brief discussions on fundamental data science concepts.

## Problem Definition
The challenge is to predict the survival status of Titanic passengers based on available information. We target to train a machine learning model to understand the relationship between passenger features and survival outcomes, enabling predictions on new, unseen data.

This constitutes a binary classification problem, where passengers are categorized as either having survived or not survived the Titanic.

## Evaluation Criteria
The competition's evaluation metric is accuracy, measured as the percentage of correctly predicted passenger data in the test set.

## Data Overview
Below are descriptions of the features in the dataset:
- **Survival:** 0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived
- **Pclass:** Ticket class (1 = First class, 2 = Second class, 3 = Third class), serving as a proxy for socio-economic status.
- **Sex:** Male or female
- **Age:** Age in years, fractional if less than 1
- **SibSp:** Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch:** Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket:** Passenger ticket number
- **Fare:** Passenger fare
- **Cabin:** Cabin number
- **Embarked:** Point of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
